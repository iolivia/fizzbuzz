## FizzBuzz around the world in all languages

### Overview
You've most likely heard of FizzBuzz, the very simple programming challenge used in interviews to see if someone can code or not. But if you haven't, here it is.

> Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
> For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
> For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
> For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

This repo is about implementing FizzBuzz in as many languages as possible.
